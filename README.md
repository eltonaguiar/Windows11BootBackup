# Windows11BootBackup
Windows Boot backup script.. after being let down by startup repair, was curious for a quick backup method as the EFI/recovery partition are small, yet a full restore of c drive takes longer..
I havent actually tested this script to see if it works.. ideally having a backup image is ideal.

Acronis True Image has perpetual license for 2025 edition, and Aomei backupper also has lifetime.
Acronis seems more user friendly in terms of estimated restore times, although Aomei seems to show the backup speed per second.. ..


Windows 11 Startup Recovery wasnt enough to restore my windows.. it just gave me some generic BOOT_DEVICE_NOT_ACCESSIBLE something like this.
I didnt try to use the "Recovery Drive" but from what I saw , you have to reinstall windows..

I have a ton of software/games.. i rather not relink them to my desktop and stuff like that.. so images are ideal in this case.


The idea is get into the "recovery environment screen"  and run a single command prompt command and be back in business, without waiting a long time for repair.. I feel like if everyone with busted Windows boot, took an image of the busted drive, then compared to a working image and ran a comparison we would eventually come with a methdology making Windows Startup issues a thing of the past (aside from failing hardware stuff).
